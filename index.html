                <h3>How does DuckDuckGo make money?
                </h3>
                <p>We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other search engines, ads are based
                    on
                    profiles compiled about you using your personal information like search, browsing, and purchase
                    history. Since we don’t collect that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the
                    search
                    results page you are viewing, not on you as a person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll
                    show you ads about cars. Learn more.</p>

                <h3>What does Google know about me?
                </h3>
                <p>Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default, their trackers have been found
                    on
                    75% of the top million websites, which means they are tracking most everywhere you go on the
                    Internet (unless you stop them with DuckDuckGo!). And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Learn

                <h3>Why use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?
                </h3>
                <p>Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part because Google tracks your
                    searches
                    and hides trackers on millions of websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t track
                    your searches and our DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app block Google’s (and many other
                    companies’) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as
                    it
                    should be. And that’s just the beginning — by using DuckDuckGo you also escape the manipulation
                    of
                    the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled).

                <h3>How do DuckDuckGo search results compare to Google’s?
                </h3>
                <p>DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without tradeoffs in result quality. We
                    have
                    everything you’ve come to expect in an online search experience, and a few bonus features that
                    make
                    searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit more fun! And, on top of that, because
                    there
                    is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble of manipulated results. Learn

                <h3>What’s the difference between using DuckDuckGo and Incognito mode?
                </h3>
                <p>It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called “Incognito” mode. In fact, Incognito
                    mode mainly just deletes information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from
                    saving
                    your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service providers, or governments from being
                    able to track you across the Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous
                    and if
                    you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you private when browsing off of search
                    results.

                </h3>
                <p>We don’t track our users, so it’s actually impossible for us to know how many users in total are
                    using our products. However, we are able to make an estimate based on the number of searches we
                    get
                    per month, which we make public. Our best guess — over 50 million people! Learn more.</p>

                <h3>How does the DuckDuckGo app & extension work?
                </h3>
                <p>The DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser mobile app and Privacy Essentials desktop extension both come with
                    our
                    best-in-class tracker blocker, encryption enforcer, and private search engine – all in one
                    simple
                    package. This gives you all the key privacy protection tools to search and browse privately,
                    curbing
                    the constant monitoring of your Internet activity by companies like Google and Facebook. Learn
