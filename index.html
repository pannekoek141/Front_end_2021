                <section class="accordionItemContent">
                    <p>We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other search engines, ads are based
                        on profiles compiled about you using your personal information like search, browsing, and
                        purchase history. Since we don’t collect that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on
                        the
                        search results page you are viewing, not on you as a person. For example, if you search for
                        cars, we’ll
                        show you ads about cars. Learn more.</p>

                <section class="accordionItemContent">
                    <p>Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default, their trackers have been found
                        on 75% of the top million websites, which means they are tracking most everywhere you go on the
                        Internet (unless you stop them with DuckDuckGo!). And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Learn

                <h3 class="accordionItemHeading">Why use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?</h3>
                <section class="accordionItemContent">
                    <p>Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part because Google tracks your
                        searches
                        and hides trackers on millions of websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t track
                        your searches and our DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app block Google’s (and many other
                        companies’) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as
                        it
                        should be. And that’s just the beginning — by using DuckDuckGo you also escape the manipulation
                        of
                        the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled).

                    <p>DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without tradeoffs in result quality. We
                        have
                        everything you’ve come to expect in an online search experience, and a few bonus features that
                        make
                        searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit more fun! And, on top of that, because
                        there
                        is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble of manipulated results. Learn

                <section class="accordionItemContent">
                    <p>It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called “Incognito” mode. In fact, Incognito
                        mode mainly just deletes information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from
                        saving
                        your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service providers, or governments from being
                        able to track you across the Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous
                        and if
                        you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you private when browsing off of search
                        results.
